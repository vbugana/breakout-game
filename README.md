# Breakout Game

Game where you control a paddle with the arrow keys to bounce a ball up to break bricks.

This app uses the HTML5 canvas element and API.

## Description

This is a simple brick breaker game. The code defines variables for the game elements such as the canvas, ball, paddle, bricks, and their properties.

It also defines functions for drawing the elements, moving them, detecting collisions, increasing score, and updating the canvas.

The code uses the `requestAnimationFrame()` method to create an animation loop that updates the canvas at a fixed rate, and event listeners to handle user input for moving the paddle.

Overall, this code provides a solid foundation for building a basic brick breaker game.
